1.Take the short leg of the LED and insert it in the GND pin.

2.Take either leg of the resistor and place it in pin 9.

3.Connect the long leg of the LED with the other leg of the resistor using an Breadboard.

4.Plug the Arduino into your computer with the USB cable

5.Open up the Arduino IDE
Open the sketch for this section.

6.Click the Verify button (top left). The button will turn orange and then blue once finished.

7.Click the Upload button. The button will turn orange and then blue when finished.

8.Launch the Serial Monito and set the baud rate to 9600

9.See the printed Contents to get an idea what is the current pwm value and how the led reacts to it.

10.Similarly understand that we can control a motor usng the same principle.

11. Read the Comments in the Program Carefully for better understanding of what is going on.
